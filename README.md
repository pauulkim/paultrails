## About
PaulTrails is a clone of [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) - an application that allows users to search for, rate, and review hiking trails. A given trail page contains information about the trail itself, including a summary, difficulty, length, and a map of the route. Users can create, read, edit and delete reviews about any trail. 

The PaulTrails backend is built using a PostgreSQL database and a Ruby on Rails framework. AJAX requests are made through jQuery to receive data from the backend. The frontend is built using React, Redux, and CSS. The site also utilizes the Google Maps API.

## Features
### Review Form
On PaulTrails, users can see all the reviews for any trail, but can only create or edit their own reviews.
